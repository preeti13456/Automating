#  Python-Based Tool for Automated Influencer Data Collection
Note: This code provides a basic framework for data collection from Instagram. For other platforms or more advanced features, you might need to adjust the scraping techniques and data extraction methods.

Important Notes:

Engagement Rate Calculation: The calculate_engagement_rate function is a placeholder. You'll need to implement a more robust method based on your specific requirements. Consider factors like post frequency, story views, and saved posts.
Rate Limiting: To avoid being blocked by Instagram, implement rate limiting. You can use libraries like time or requests_ratelimiter to control the frequency of requests.
Data Storage: For larger datasets, consider using a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
Error Handling: Handle potential errors like network issues or changes in Instagram's HTML structure.
Scalability: For large-scale campaigns, explore parallel processing or distributed computing techniques.
This code provides a foundation for influencer data collection. You can extend it with additional features like filtering, connection automation, and integration with other tools.
